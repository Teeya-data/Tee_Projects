## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the Toman Bikes Company understand their sales and profits over the years 2021 and 2022 and to help Toman Bikes understand if increasing prices will be possible next year.

From my analysis, I saw that the average price of a bike in 2021 was $3.99 and increased to $4.99 in the following year. There was a 25% price increase which saw a gigantic increase in the profits made and revenue generated.
